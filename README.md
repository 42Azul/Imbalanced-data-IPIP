# Imbalanced-data-IPIP

This repository contains the implementation of an ensemble-based training algorithm for imbalanced data using the IPIP approach. The algorithm combines different training algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Regularized Logistic Regression (RLOG), and Random Forest (RANGER) in R scripts.

## Background

This project is a part of a Bachelor's thesis focused on handling imbalanced data in the context of health systems, specifically related to the COVID-19 dataset. The aim is to develop an effective method for training models with imbalanced data using the IPIP technique.

## Methodology

The IPIP (Imbalanced Problem Identification and Prediction) approach is utilized to address the imbalanced data problem. The algorithm forms ensembles by combining multiple base learners, including SVM, RLOG, and RANGER. These base learners are implemented in R scripts, leveraging their respective capabilities in handling imbalanced datasets.
